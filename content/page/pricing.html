<h4>Wedding stationery price list</h4>


<h5>Ready made (non exclusive hand drawn designs)</h5>
<p>EUR 80.00 - 100.00<p>
The final price depends on the number of items/design variations we need to produce.
<p>
  You can choose entire designs or separate elements from my pre-designed collection.
  The collection is being constantly updated. I edit a template or mix and combine the elements
  and offer you 3 - 4 options to choose from.
<p>
  Click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3qf9sk3jm6cm94u/AABSrOJ8upoYBPuSWegX2KeKa?dl=0">here</a> to see the pre-designed collection.
</p>


<h5>Custom (exclusive hand drawn designs)</h5>
<p>EUR 130.00 - 160.00<p>
The final price depends on the number of items/design variations we need to produce.
<p>
  You can order any items such as invitations, save the dates, table numbers, place
  cards, envelopes, posters etc. Usually I create one design and modify and adapt it to
  various items.
</p>

<h5>Printing</h5>
<p>
  It's hard to state printing prices without knowing what to print=) Here are some rough estimates:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>50 invitations - EUR 35.00</li>
  <li>50 A6 save the date cards - EUR 25.00</li>
  <li>50 place cards with names - EUR 12.00</li>
  <li>A3/A2 seating chart poster - EUR 12.00/15.00</li>
</ul>

<p>
This pricing can be an approximate estimate for other types of designs (logos, business cards, posters) taking into consideration the types of illustrations we use (existing/custom), the number of designs we need to create. Email me for an estimate.
