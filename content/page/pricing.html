<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>
Please remember that texts of the paper products are the responsibility of the client.
I copy the texts which you send me. I do my best but I might not notice a typo. I might not know how names of places and people are spelled.
Also, I cannot know the correct dates and other info with numbers.
There will be plenty of time to double-check the texts before your cards are sent to printing.
