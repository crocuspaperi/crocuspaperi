<p>
My name is Irina, I am a watercolor and line art illustrator based in Finland. I'm Russian originally, and I came to Finland to do my Master's Degree in cultural heritage studies. Studies were fun, worklife afterwards was't=) So, I ended up drawing flowers and designing beautiful stationery with my illustrations.
</p>

<p>
I create wedding stationery, postcards and greeting cards, logos, business cards and branding materials. And anything else you can put floral and botanical illustrations on.
</p>

<h4>I offer two types of services</h4>

<ul>
<li>
ready - made designs;
</li>

<li>
custom designs.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wedding stationery price list</h4>


<h5>Ready made (non exclusive hand drawn designs)</h5>
<p>
EUR 80.00 - 100.00
<p>
The final price depends on the number of items/design variations we need to produce.
<p>
You can choose entire designs or separate elements from my pre-designed collection.
The collection is being constantly updated. I edit a template or mix and combine the elements
and offer you 3 - 4 options to choose from.
<p>
Click <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3qf9sk3jm6cm94u/AABSrOJ8upoYBPuSWegX2KeKa?dl=0">here</a> to see the pre-designed collection.
</p>


<h5>Custom (exclusive hand drawn designs)</h5>
<p>
EUR 130.00 - 160.00
<p>
The final price depends on the number of items/design variations we need to produce.
<p>
You can order any items such as invitations, save the dates, table numbers, place
cards, envelopes, posters etc. Usually I create one design and modify and adapt it to
various items.
</p>

<h5>Printing</h5>
<p>
It's hard to state printing prices without knowing what to print=) Here are some rough estimates:<p>

<ul>
<li>
50 invitations - EUR 35.00
</li>

<li>
50 A6 save the date cards - EUR 25.00
</li>

<li>
50 place cards with names - EUR 12.00
</li>

<li>
A3/A2 seating chart poster - EUR 12.00/15.00
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This pricing can be an approximate estimate for other types of designs (logos, business cards, posters) taking into consideration the types of illustrations we use (existing/custom), the number of designs we need to create. Email me for an estimate.
</p>

<h4>How I work</h4>

<p>1. Idea</p>
<p>You describe your idea to me, we define the final product to be delivered and the schedule for our project</p>

<p>2. First sketches</p>
<p>I send you the first pencil sketches. I make the necessary corrections according to your comments.</p>

<p>3. Drawing</p>
<p>I draw the design elements and correct if necessery.</p>

<p>4. Editing</p>
<p>I send several options of the designs for you to choose from.</p>

<p>5. Delivery</p>
<p>I upload your designs to a Dropbox folder, where they are available for 2 weeks for you to download. Prints are delivered to you by post (delivery is included in the price) or in case of large posters (they are easily damaged) I deliver prints in person or ask you to pick them up from the printing place yourself.</p>
<p>P.S. I really love printng=) It makes me super happy to choose paper and formats with the clients, receive the prints and pack them. I'm happy to show you paper samples and choose the right style.</p>
