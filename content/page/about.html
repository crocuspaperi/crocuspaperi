My name is Irina and I am an illustrator/designer based in Finland. Drawing floral and botanical motifs has been my long time hobby which turned into an occupation. My favourite forms are watercolor illustrations and calligraphy.  Most of the items you see on this website are hand drawn first and then digitized and edited.

<h5>I offer two types of services:</h5>

<ul>
<li>
ready - made wedding sets and stationery you can see on the website (prices are available in descriptions);
