<h4>FAQ</h4>

<p><b>How long does wedding stationery design take?</b></p>
<p><u>Ready made designs:</u> max. 1 week for design/comments from you and corrections + 2 weeks for printing.
  <u>Custom designs:</u> max. 2.5 weeks for design/comments from you and corrections + 2 weeks for printing.
  In the peak times these terms might be longer. <u>Foil printing</u> might take up to 3 weeks.
  Printing time does not depend on me though, because I print in various printing companies.
</p>

<p><b>Is it possible to receive the designs/prints faster?</b></p>
<p>Yes it is! If you prepare your texts in advance, less time will be spent on corrections. The quicker you give me feedback, the sooner the designs will go to printing. Express printing is possible too. Express printing is + 40% of the standard printing price.</p>

<p><b>We want invitations, menus and place cards, but we don‚Äôt have info for the menus or a confirmed guests list yet. Can we order these later?</b></p>
<p>Of course! I usually work in stages, first we deal with invitations, then, if needed, with all the rest closer to the wedding day. Please keep in mind printing times (2 weeks).</p>

<p><b>Is it possible to make changes in the read-made designs?</b></p>
<p>
  Yes! Design price stays the same if you  want to add/modify something in a template. Modifications are already included in the price because I love to offer a choice of fonts, layouts etc. to make each design special.
</p>

<p><b>Do you always print on the same paper?</b></p>
<p>No, there are several paper options available, and I always search for new ones. I understand it‚Äôs hard to choose paper by looking at the photos, that‚Äôs why I offer <u>free paper samples</u> by post. You can order to receive them by post by sending me a message/email. If you want to discuss the design details personally, you will see all kinds of paper at the meeting.
</p>

<p><b>Do you design logos and branding stuff?</b></p>
<p>Yes, I do logos and branding products (details and prices <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x3uqqhlgtime6cl/logo_pricing_hinnasto.pdf?dl=0">here</a>). I create custom logo designs and also I have a large collection of ready-made illustrations which can be used to create logos. The link to the available designs is not public for copyright reasons. I want to keep logo designs special even if they are made with the illustrations I made before. I can send you a link if you are interested.
</p>

<p><b>Do you speak Finnish?</b></p>
<p>I write in Finnish, so in most cases if I receive an email in Finnish I try to reply in Finnish. I will reply in English if I‚Äôm busy or if there is something urgent, because writing in Finnish takes more time. Also I have a person who helps me with emails in Finnish sometimes.
</p>
<p>As for speaking, I can speak in daily situations, but I don‚Äôt feel confident to discuss work in Finnish yet. So, when I meet with clients/talk on the phone I inform beforehand that it would be great if we used English. But please be sure I understand everything you write/almost everything you tell me in Finnishüòâ
