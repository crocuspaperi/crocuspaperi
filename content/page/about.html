<p>
My name is Irina, I am a watercolor and line art illustrator based in Finland. I'm Russian originally, and I came to Finland to do my Master's Degree in cultural heritage studies. Studies were fun, worklife afterwards wasn't=) So, I ended up drawing flowers and designing beautiful stationery with my illustrations.
</p>

<p>
I create <b>wedding stationery, postcards and greeting cards, logos, business cards and branding materials</b>. And anything else you can put floral and botanical illustrations on.
</p>

<h4>I offer three types of services</h4>

<ul>
  <li>ready - made designs</li>
  <li>custom designs</li>
  <li>poscards and greeting cards with my illustrations in my <a href="http://shop.crocuspaperi.com/">online shop</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>How I work</h4>

<p>1. Idea</p>
<p>You describe your idea to me, we define the final product to be delivered and the schedule for our project</p>

<p>2. First sketches</p>
<p>I send you the first pencil sketches. I make the necessary corrections according to your comments.</p>

<p>3. Drawing</p>
<p>I draw the design elements and correct if necessery.</p>

<p>4. Editing</p>
<p>I send several options of the designs for you to choose from.</p>

<p>5. Delivery</p>
<p>
  I upload your designs to a Dropbox folder, where they are available for 2 weeks for you to download. Prints are delivered to you by post (delivery is included in the price) or in case of large posters (they are easily damaged) I deliver prints in person or ask you to pick them up from the printing place yourself.
</p>
<p>
  P.S. I really love printng=) It makes me super happy to choose paper and formats with the clients, receive the prints and pack them. I'm happy to show you paper samples and choose the right style.
